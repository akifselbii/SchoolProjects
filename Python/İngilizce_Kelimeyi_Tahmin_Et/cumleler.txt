I will write a letter to Ayşe tomorrow
I went to London and I saw Ayşe
I ate ice-cream but Ayşe didn’t eat
I learned English perfectly because I studied very hard
My mother washed the vegatables then she cut them into little pieces
I was drinking tea and Ayşe was drinking coffee
I saw Ali yesterday but he didn’t see me
That is the house which I want
He was watching television when I came in
Ali couldn’t go to England although he wanted very much
Last night I saw the girl who loves my brother
The girl whom you met in our home is my cousin
The flowers which you brought me were very beautiful
The book that I read was very interesting
The boy whose eyes are green is Ayşe’s brother
I don’t know who broke the window
I couldn’t understand why she left me
But you don’t know what it is to be old
I know what it is to be young
Whoever visits our village doesn’t want to leave
I am a computer programmer in a company
